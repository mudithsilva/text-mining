    "As you can see, each row of the data frame contains a pair $(m, e)$ of a mention $m$ and an entity $e$, as well as the conditional probability $P(e|m)$ for mention $m$ referring to entity $e$. These probabilities were estimated based on the frequencies of mention–entity pairs in the knowledge base. The example shows that the anchor text &lsquo;Sweden&rsquo; is most often used to refer to the entity [Sweden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden), but in a few cases also to refer to Sweden&rsquo;s national football and ice hockey teams. Note that references are sorted in decreasing order of probability, so that the most probable pairing come first.\n",
