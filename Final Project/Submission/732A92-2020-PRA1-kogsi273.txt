Since the development of social media networks, more and more businesses have been using chat services to attract more customers by providing real-time information for their potential or existing customers. Medium or large scale businesses have a dedicated customer service person to cater to their online customers’ needs. But for small-scale businesses are unable to compete with their rival companies since they have a limited amount of employees and unable to pay for an extra person for online customer handling. And also there are some special service-related businesses in which the owner needs to directly interact with customers. So they can’t use an employee to handle their customer because of the business model or they can’t expose customer information with another party.
